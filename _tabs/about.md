# Profile

I'm Bo Huang, a multidisciplinary professional and second-year Master's student at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology. My academic journey spans across Material Science, Chemical Engineering, and Computer Technology. Currently, I'm developing a program dedicated to MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) assembly and modification, an intersection of my academic knowledge and practical application.

## Education

- **Computer Technology, Beijing, China. M.S.** , [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/) , 2021-2024
  - Guided by Professor [Hui Li](http://www.whoeveryou.com/), a renowned researcher in the field of Mathematics and Computer science. Beyond academia, Professor Li has provided immense support and mentorship in various aspects of thought and life, profoundly influencing my personal and professional growth.
  - Focusing my studies on advanced computational methods and their application in the field of Material Science. My current research project involves developing software for high-throughputcomputational analysis of MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) membrane materials.

- **Material Science and Engineering, Beijing, China. B.S.** , [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/) , 2017-2021
  - Acquired broad knowledge base in fields such as Chemistry (Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, and Electrochemistry), Material Science (Introduction to Materials, Materials Physics and Materials Chemistry), and Chemical Engineering Principles.
  - Further specialized in inorganic non-metallic materials, studying Advanced Ceramic Materials, Thermal Engineering Fundamentals, and Powder Engineering in my third year.
  - Applied my knowledge in the thesis project “Preparation and Electrochemical Performance Study of Cathode Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.”

## Project Experience

- **Automated Modification of MOFs**
  - **Project Description and Purpose:** The project was designed to innovate and streamline the modification process of MOFs. While prior work involved using pre-modified nodes and edges to assemble MOFs, which often led to a monotonous outcome and required significant alterations if results were unsatisfactory, my program aimed to overcome these limitations. It allows for the generation of a large variety of basic MOFs first, using unmodified nodes and edges, with the flexibility to add diverse modification groups later.
  - **Role and Key Contributions:** As the lead developer, I devised an innovative approach, creating an algorithm capable of recognizing minimal modification location data in input cif files. This algorithm facilitated the addition of a myriad of modification groups to MOFs, significantly enhancing modification diversity and reducing the margin of error.
  - **Technologies and Methodologies:** My project utilized the Kabsch algorithm for the precise alignment and identification of modification points within MOFs. Programming was executed using Python, supplemented with molecular visualization software for accurate process monitoring. Future plans include the application of machine learning methodologies to further optimize the search and replacement processes, thereby improving the overall system efficiency and precision.
  - **Results, Impact, and Learnings:** The program successfully automated the MOF modification process and increased the diversity of modifications. This innovative approach allows for the potential refinement of various applications in MOF-related fields such as clean energy, environmental science, and pharmaceuticals. The project underscored the power of flexible design, the precision needed in molecular simulations, and the effectiveness of the Kabsch algorithm. Moreover, it highlighted the importance of planning for future improvements, such as incorporating machine learning, to continuously enhance system performance.
